# UEFI Secure Boot Part 1: chain of trust

PK KEK DB

Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) provides a specification for the interface between hardware firmware and OS (operating system). As suggested by the name, UEFI should be more powerful than legacy BIOS. One proof is you can use a mouse and touchpad in UEFI but not in BIOS. One funny thing is I used to help fix a touchpad bug [1] in Linux but the touchpad actually works flawlessly in BIOS. Part of the specification defines Secure Boot which is to make sure your computer runs trusted OS. So how is the trust relationship between the firmware and OS established? In UEFI Secure Boot, there are three core concepts,
 - platform key (PK)
 - The Key Exchange Key (KEK)
 - The key database (DB)

If you're still confused, don't worry, I'll first go through Public-key cryptography and HTTPS chain of trust to help you grasp these concepts. From the perspective of public-key cryptography, the concepts of end-user certificate, intermediate certificate, root certificate in HTTPS certificate chain of trust are the same as the concepts of DB, KEK and PK in UEFI secure boot.

## Public-key cryptography

Suppose you want to send a message to your friend over the Internet, but what if someone is eavesdropping you? You get the idea to have the message encrypted with a key, much like using a key to lock a door. Then the new problem is how can you send the key itself to your friend over the Internet? Remember, you're being eavesdropped on..

The ultimate solution is public-key cryptography. Instead of using the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message, you use a pair of keys. A message encrypted by one key can only be decrypted by the other key and vice versa. If you choose to distribute any of the two keys to the public, then this key becomes the public key and the other key that you keep private becomes the private key. If you want to send your message to your friend, you can ask your friend to send his public key to you. You use his public key to encrypt the message and then send it. So even if someone has intercepted the public key and the encrypted message, he still doesn't know the content of the message because the message can only be decrypted by your friend's private key.

But what if the person who's eavesdropping on you just pretends to be your friend and sends his own public key instead of your friend's to you? This is the so-called middleman attack. How can you tell if the received public key belongs to your friend? The answer is certificate authority which certifies the ownership of the key. Your friend would send his public key to a certificate authority. This certificate authority also has its own pair of keys and will encrypt your friend's public key with the private key. Your friend would send his public key together with the encrypted public key by the certificate authority to you. If you trust this certificate authority and find the encrypted public key can be decrypted using the certificate authority's public key, then this public key comes from your friend.

In the case of safely browsing the Internet, the trust model involves more than one certificate authority. The so-called chain of trust includes an end-user certificate, an intermediate certificate, and a root certificate..

## Chain of trust

In the chain of trust, your root trust is the root authority. The trust then extends to immediate certificate which in turn to the end-entity certificate finally,

Now let's get our hands dirty to verify the theory.

1. download the certificates using the openssl (you can also download via Firefox -> The Lock button -> Connection secure -> More Info -> View Certificate  -> Download PEM (chain))
```
openssl s_client -connect coiby.github.io:443 -showcerts | sed -n '/-----BEGIN/,/-----END/p' > certs.pem
```
2. You will see three certificates enclosed by "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----",
```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIHMDCCBhigAwIBAgIQAkk+B/qeN1otu8YdlEMPzzANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADBw
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIEsTCCA5mgAwIBAgIQBOHnpNxc8vNtwCtCuF0VnzANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADBs
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDxTCCAq2gAwIBAgIQAqxcJmoLQJuPC3nyrkYldzANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQUFADBs
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```
3. save them as three single certificates,

```
$ cat end.pem
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIHMDCCBhigAwIBAgIQAkk+B/qeN1otu8YdlEMPzzANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADBw
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

$ cat immediate.pem
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIEsTCCA5mgAwIBAgIQBOHnpNxc8vNtwCtCuF0VnzANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADBs
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

$ cat root.pem
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDxTCCAq2gAwIBAgIQAqxcJmoLQJuPC3nyrkYldzANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQUFADBs
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

4.  Take the end certificate as an example, `openssl x509`  would (you can also use GUI app gcr-viewer to view a certificate) print the following info for you,

```
$ openssl x509 -text -in end.pem

7.  For RSA decryption, we have the formula,
$$
signature^{65537} \bmod modulus
$$
8. From the immediate public key info, we have the modulus and exponent (=65537), the hash value of the end certificate is,
```
>>> modulus=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

```

Now Let's verify if the decrypted hash of the certificate is correct. 

1. First, end.pem itself contains the signature, we need to extract the certificate body from end.pem.
```
$ openssl asn1parse -in end.pem -strparse 4 -out end_body.bin
    0:d=0  hl=4 l=1560 cons: SEQUENCE          
    4:d=1  hl=2 l=   3 cons: cont [ 0 ]        
    6:d=2  hl=2 l=   1 prim: INTEGER           :02
    9:d=1  hl=2 l=  16 prim: INTEGER           :02493E07FA9E375A2DBBC61D94430FCF
   27:d=1  hl=2 l=  13 cons: SEQUENCE          
   29:d=2  hl=2 l=   9 prim: OBJECT            :sha256WithRSAEncryption
   40:d=2  hl=2 l=   0 prim: NULL              
   ...
```
2. then let's get the SHA hash of the certificate,
```
$ openssl dgst -sha256 end_body.bin 
SHA256(end_body.bin)= 0640f8d13c0789ff0ed5437cf4bc9f2827d52146dddff38aefc2c17747d45f28
```
3. See? The above string exactly matches the trailing end of $signature^{65537} \bmod modulus$
